Today I worked on details for the first level I will build. I included the various resources involved in that level,
the various units for the level, and the prices involved in the production of those units. I decided upon the
countries involved in the level, the units that each country can build, and what historical event the level is
going to be set in. I included in my list of details some of the various features I intend to add such as having
wounded troops, and giving a way to reintegrate them into an army, or having some units give some resources when
they are destroyed; for example a destroyed tank might give some metal. I also put some thought into how the
battles will work, and how resource production will function. I am intending to have each bit of territory
produce a certain amount of each resource, basing that amount off of what information I can find of the resources
during that battle/war.

An incredible amount of work has been done. I designed two of my maps and worked on the program itself.
Between 50% and 75% of the basic programing for the first map is complete. The most critical thing will be
constructing the GUI for the game and making it functional. I also need to finish up work on how battles will
work and get the units working right. Then I will have to work on the AI for the first map, which will be most
difficult. I then will have to work on the next map which I plan to be a "generated" environment, that is to say
it will create AIs with different "personalities", generate random names for things, and generate who starts out
with what. (This could get very complicated.) I am also planning for the next map to be in "space" (it is in reality
a grid of hexagons). I also want the next map to focus somewhat more on individual units, with massive ships
being able to smash countless smaller ones. I plan for the next map to also include politics, and trade with other
players and AIs.
