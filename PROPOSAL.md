# Proposal: [Der Neue Kriegsspiel]
## [Turn based strategy game with historic battles and a basic AI]
[Joshua Givens]

## Needs and Opportunities
[I have noticed that AIs are really stupid and that games aren't always historically
accurate. I intend to try to fix these problems.]


## Audience / Clients / Users
[My audience is those who like strategy games. I believe I can recruit some
friends to test my project, and I will also test it.]

## Product
[I intend to at least have a basic game with some of the functions described
before. I intend to have turn based multiplayer, many campain levels, various
units for each level, simulate wounded troops, bring forwards the relevance
of avialible manpower, and give the AI some inteligence.]

## Timeline


| Date          | Deliverable   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| February 26   | Linear Battle |
| April 1       | AI Navigation |
| April 29      | Campain Level |

## Reality Check
[There should be no complex equipment required for this project.]

## Conclusion
[This will hopefully be a great and fun game. If everything works it will be
an epic game and offer some history lessons on the side.]
