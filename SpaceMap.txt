\
Unit Prices:\
N/A\
\
Buildings:\
Farm, Factory, Mine, Trading Center, Light Defense Battery, Medium Defense Battery, Heavy Defense Battery, Hangar\
\
Building Prices:\
N/A\
\
Resource Production:\
Population generates .1 money, and .1 other (depends on your government) \
Farm generates 2000 food\
Mine generates 800 metal\
Factory generates 800 industry\
Trading Center generates 500 money\
(Production is modified by government and technology)\
\
Space:\
Each planet has a certain amount of space that is available for constructing buildings on, this space can be increased with technology and terraforming.\
\
Technology:\
Agriculture, Industrialization, Advanced Mining, Improved Finances, Space Efficiency (More space on a planet), Shields and Armor, Deadlier Weapons\
(+ 10% per level in applicable subject, can end up multiplying significantly)\
\
Terraforming:\
Not all planets are fully habitable, and resources are needed to change this.\
\
Population:\
Generates most of the critical gold and other resources needed to run your economy. Requires 1 food per turn, but population can be allowed to drop at a rate of 1% per turn (except communists, which can drop at whatever rate they want) if it costs to much food, it costs 5 food to add a population.\
\
Government:\
\
At the start of every game you must choose a government type, and the policies, the policies can be changed, but the government type can't.\
\
	Communist (Economy: Collective resources or Government and private cooperative control of industry, Foreign Policy: any except trade oriented or colony focused), no	money (industry instead), can starve citizens\
	Federal Republic (Economy: private industry, Foreign Policy: any), +5% resources\
	Monarchy  (Economy: any, Foreign Policy: any), vassal resources +5%\
	Confederation (Economy: private industry, Foreign Policy: peaceful coexistence, trade oriented or defensive), +20% attack/defense in home territory, can't start a war\
	Fascist (Economy: any, Foreign Policy: any except peaceful coexistence oriented), + 5% attack/defense in combat\
	Oligarchy (Economy: Government and private cooperative control of industry or private industry, Foreign Policy: any), player is given goals, +5% resources for completing them, -5% for failing them\
	\
		Economy: Government control (full control of production), Government and private cooperative control of industry (partial control of production, + 5% resources), 		Private industry (no control over production, + 10% resources),\
		Foreign Policy: Expansive ( + 5% attack/defense in combat, can attack neighbors), Defensive (+ 15% attack/defense in home territory, can attack weak neighbors as a 		"defensive" maneuver), Trade Oriented (+5% resources, +20% money from trade), Peaceful Coexistence Oriented (+5% resources, +20% resources when at peace, 		can't start war), Colony Focused (+5% resources, -5% money from trade, +5% attack/defense against weak players, can attack weak players,)\
\
Culture:\
Your "country's" culture is a value decided at the beginning of the game and cannot be changed.\
Commercial (+5% money), Aggressive (+5% attack/defense), Xenophobic (-5% money from trade, +5% attack/defense in home territory), Peaceful (-5% attack/defense)\
\
Upkeep:\
As you build things you will notice that each building or ship costs 1*size money per turn, and each fighter costs .1 gold per turn, also inflation starts adding on at a rate of 1% per turn. If you fail to meet the upkeep, you will suffer a penalty of -90% food, metal, and if you are not communist also -90% industry, and a -90% attack/defense penalty. Your score will drop significantly encouraging attacks against you. Don't run out of money!\
\
Blockade:\
N/A\
\
Trade:\
During the game it will be necessary to sell/trade/buy resources/planets/ship/"agreements".\
\
Puppets:\
In some cases you can force a defeated power to become a puppet; it's score is added to yours, and it's diplomacy is the same as yours and it must help you when you ask it to.\
\
Vassals:\
In some cases a weak power may become a vassal; half it's score is added to yours, and it is tied diplomatically and militarily to you; it can break its state of vassalage if it chooses to.\
\
Rebellion:\
In some cases there are rebellions on planets (especially when there isn't enough food or money), which can try to form a new "country". These rebellions can be backed by other powers (you can back a rebellion against your neighbor, however this will hurt your diplomacy).\
\
Diplomacy:\
Diplomacy is your relationship with other players. It is a tool to get resources, make wars manageable/avoidable, and can increase your score (having lots of friends is a good thing). \
\
War:\
\
\
Free Passage:\
This is an agreement that allows units to enter another "country's" territory, it can be mutual, paid for, or a "gift" to help someone kill an enemy more easily. Also gives +50 gold per connected planet when the agreement is mutual. If you declare war on someone while you have troops in their area, no one will want to sign a free passage agreement with you, everyone who isn't REALLY good friends with you will cancel their trades with you, and diplomacy in general will be hurt by your treachery.\
\
Galactic Council:\
An attempt at galactic peace that failed. It is now a weak organization, that could be used to one's advantage.\
\
Loans:\
Sometimes during a war you might run out of money or metal, in which case you could try to get a loan from another "country"; you can also give a loan to someone who needs it. (Loans can be given as support to a friend, or simply for the money you can get back for it.) Loans have a 1% per turn interest rate. Loans can also be left unpaid, however no one will want to give a loan to that player again, and diplomacy in general will be hurt by your dishonesty.}
